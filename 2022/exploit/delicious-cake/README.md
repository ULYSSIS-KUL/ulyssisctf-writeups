Delicious Cake
=========

When you open the website, you find a number of cake recipes. While these are surely delicious, they're not very interactive or interesting.

However, the page does contain a section for you to leave comments, which seems to have been used by Grandma's adoring fans in times past. Curiously, we have the option of leaving a comment that is not 'Public', presumably only visible to the webmaster. If we do this, we are redirected to a page where we can inspect our message. On returning to the main page, the message is indeed nowhere to be seen.

Every other comment is equipped with a permanent link, which redirects to a page very similar to the one we saw after posting a message. Posting a comment that *is* 'public' reveals that these pages are in fact one and the same: the URL for both is "/msg/51"! The comments seem to be identified by their number, which increases every time we post one, even for private comments.

If we now hover over every link, we may notice some gaps: the number of comments on the page is smaller than the index of the last comment! Perhaps we were not the only one leaving secret messages to our grandma? Perhaps the only thing preventing us from seeing these is the knowledge of their index?

And indeed, manually crafting a URL of the form "/msg/12" reveals the message with index 12, whether it was hidden or not. If we look for every such hidden message, we find one that contains the flag! Perhaps something so private shouldn't be unauthenticated and simply numbered.
