# pay-to-win

When surfing to this apparently so amazing flag emporium, we are greeted with what appears to be a fairly standard webshop. We can add flags to our cart, empty our cart, and buy flags; but only if we have sufficient balance!

It also seems that there is a flag in this store called 'The Flag', which could very well contain the solution to this challenge. However, we lack the money to buy this flag.

Buying three Milwaukee city flags, or any number of Soviet flags, won't help us. We can put any number of flags in our cart, though... And the prices don't have decimals. Hm.

Sure enough, if we put so many flags in our cart that the total price is more than about 36000, the price is suddenly negative! It seems the price was stored as a 16-bit signed integer, without any checks on whether this could overflow. Pressing 'Buy' now not only puts these flags into our inventory, it also *gives* us money! Amazing!

Using this exploit, or our newfound wealth, to purchase 'The Flag' does indeed give us the flag! Bingo!
