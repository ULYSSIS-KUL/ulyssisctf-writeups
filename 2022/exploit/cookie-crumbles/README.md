# cookie-crumbles

This recipe repository website has some pretty lacklustre security. Using a login supplied in the flavour text, you can log in and browse recipes. If you look at the (browser) cookie that the website sets, it contains a json with as one of its parameters "is_admin". If you change that from 0 to 1 you suddenly have admin rights and can browse hidden recipes. One of the private, hidden recipes is one for "Flag cookies". The flag is the special ingredient.
