You are shown the login screen of a UniFi Security Gateway. There is nothing else to see, so you probably have to log in. Entering a random username and password of course leads to a login error.

A quick search with your favorite search engine tells you that the default login details are `ubnt` as username and `ubnt` as password. Filling those in gives you the flag.
