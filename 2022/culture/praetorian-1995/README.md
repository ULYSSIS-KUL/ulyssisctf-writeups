# praetorian-1995

This culture challenge is a reference to the hacker movie The Net from 1995. In one scene, Angela logs in into the Medical Records Deparment of the Navy Hospital at Bethesda using an address and password she has found on a card. Lots of references to the film are included in the flavor text. The given username, rcds.bnh@navdc.mil, leads directly to the password: BER5348833. That reveals the flag.
