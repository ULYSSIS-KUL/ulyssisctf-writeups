# sneaky-contact

This is a culture challenge, so that means some simple googling (or knowing about your hacker movies) can get you a flag. In this case, words like Martin Bishop, Too many secrets and Cootys Rat Semen point to the film Sneakers, and especially a clip where they figure out anagrams of SETEC Astronomy and then contact the NSA. This challenge is reversed in order, and SETEC Astronomy has to be entered while the anagrams are already given. Once you enter SETEC Astronomy, the flag is returned.
