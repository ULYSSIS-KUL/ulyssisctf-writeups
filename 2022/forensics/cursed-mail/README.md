# cursed-mail writeup

The challenge consists of an email file with different HTML and plain text
contents, using [MIME Multipart
message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Multipart_messages). The HTML
version contains an "I have recorded you watching pr0n"-spam mesasge, while
the plaintext version contains the key.

Opening the file in your mail client and setting the view settings to
plaintext-only solves the challenge.
