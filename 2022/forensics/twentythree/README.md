In this challenge the participants need to demonstrate that they're able to
make a connection using `telnet`.

They are greeted with an [oldschool plasma
effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_effect), a
[raymarched](http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/) morphing cube/sphere, and a
[Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) zoomer. After this
has finished, they are given the flag.
