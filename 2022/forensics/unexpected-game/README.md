# unexpected-game

This game initially seems impossible to win. It plays soothing music and displays peaceful images of nature for a few seconds, then unexpectedly replaces that with the Spanish Inquisition, which means you've lost the game. Either by pressing some buttons (which plays audio cues) or looking at the source, it becomes clear that something needs to be typed to win the game. In the source, the password "biggus dickus" is very obviously mentioned and checked within a codeblock about keypresses. It's also the only part of the code that can stop the timer for the Spanish Inquisition. If the player types biggus dickus, the game will make a complex request (which a user could emulate, but doesn't have to) to retrieve the key and displays that the player is a true Biggus Dickus, with the flag as the prize.
