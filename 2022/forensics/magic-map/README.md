# magic-map

This is a challenge all about looking at the HTML source. The player is greeted by what seems like a point-and-click game of a magic map with clickable areas that show funny gifs. However, a small area on the side is also clickable and leads to a secret set of hacker challenges. This can easily be detected from the source, where only one area does not have a title and has a suspicious sounding link to the "hacker" folder. After finishing this first hacker challenge, 2 remain. The first one shows a gif of some numbers and words with the text "Got any comments on that?" underneath. This is a hint that there's a comment in the source to the next link. The third challenge is a loop between several pages of lots and lots of lorem ipsum. One of the pages has a link to the flag page at the end. This can either be found by timely opening the source for every page in the loop, tracking the loop using a tool like curl and then extracting the link, or using something like devtools to stop the loop. The flag is displayed with the actual flag contents in black on a black background. This last step however is pretty obvious by highlighting, so looking in the source isn't even necessary.
