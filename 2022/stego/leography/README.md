The initial received image is that of the famous painting of The Last Supper by Leonardo Da Vinci. While taking a closer look to the characters on the painting, you could notice a small arrow on one apostles. By looking this character up on the internet, you can learn that this is Judas. Back at the flavortext, a hint is dropped "not everything is always what it seems to be in appearance". This hint means that the .jpg file you received may not actually be an image, but instead a .zip file. This could also have been discovered by running certain linux commands like "file", "binwalk" or "zip" against this file. Next you can extract a directory with another .zip file from the mystery.jpg. On this zip file is a password, the password for the file is 'Judas'. With this information you can extract a new directory with an image and a pdf. The image is another mystery of Leonardo Da Vinci. The objective is to find the name of the person on the painting, this can be done by browsing the internet for mysteries of Da Vinci or by a reverse image lookup. You'll find her name is Isabella d'Este. So as a password for the pdf you will need to enter her first name 'Isabella'. Inside the pdf you will find the flag.
