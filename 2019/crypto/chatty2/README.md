# chatty2

This is the second version of the notorious Chatty Bot. It's a chat bot able to respond to users based on recognising certain keywords. Its response are then decoded. Last year, ascii numbers were used, this year another method was used, namely rot13. This can be easily deduced by the fact that there's very often capital V in the responses (rot13 of I) and all punctation remains. If you ask for the flag, chatty says you need to tell him you love him. When replying with "I love you", the bot will respond with the flag.
