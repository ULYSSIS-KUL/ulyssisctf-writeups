# layered-cake

The name is a pun on the fact that SVGs can be layered, and that it features a layered birthday cake on a card. The card is made of brown rectangles on top of a pink rectangle to make the cake. But if you go and explore the SVG in a program like inkscape or even just by hand in a browser, you can see how the entire card is also stacked rectangles: a white one over a red one. Weirdly enough, the SVG starts with a path, and not a rectangle. If you remove all the rectangles and the path for the title. You can see that there's a path underneath the entire card that spells out the flag: FLG{89a63b84ef8100ae8e8683e98271a9bc977c99ff9148}
