# falkens-maze

The name of this challenge, as well as the names professor Falken, NORAD and WOPR are references to the film WarGames from 1983. As with any culture challenge, simply googling easily yields the result. If you Google "password wopr" you already get the password: Joshua. The flag is then displayed as an archived message.
