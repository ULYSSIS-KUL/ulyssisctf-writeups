## Hypodermic
'hypodermic', as in, a hypodermic needle. For injections. SQL injections. That's all this challenge is, one simply has to inject SQL into the user (or password) field. The various PHP errors and warnings are there for decoration, they don't actually do anything.

Two approaches are possible: injecting your own username/password, or making the password check always pass.
* Own username: `'; INSERT INTO users VALUES('attacker', 'password');--`
* Making check pass: `' OR 1=1;--`
Of course, plenty of other attacks are possible.

Technical fun fact: the first kind of SQL injection vulnerability is very hard to implement in PHP 7, as most SQL functions will only execute a *single* query before terminating, thus ignoring any subsequent injected queries. To make this possible, I get the result of each query and then execute it entirely *again*.
