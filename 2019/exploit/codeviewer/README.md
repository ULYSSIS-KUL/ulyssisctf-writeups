# Codeviewer writeup

Codeviewer is a simple path traversal challenge.

When accessing the website, you are greeted with just 2 projects. When clicking on one of them you'll see the code shown below.
If you look at the url you can see the following:
```
/?project=snelSLiM analyzer.go
```

It seems like the project parameter value is just the filename of the project. This is the key. You can just enter a relative path and the file, if it exists, will be shown below.

We don't know where the webroot is so we just try some things.

The solution is `../../etc/passwd` which will show the passwd file with the flag in the comment field of the codeviewer user.
