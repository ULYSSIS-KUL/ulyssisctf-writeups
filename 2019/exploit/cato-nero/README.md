# cato-nero writeup

cato-nero (**C**ompile **A**nd **T**est **O**nline PHP **N**ow **E**asy **R**un **O**nline) is a fairly straightforward challenge where you have to break out of the sandbox the online PHP interpreter gives you. Because the site just runs your code using PHP's `eval()` construct without any safeties enabled, there are many ways to go about this.

The flag can be found assigned to a variable in a file called `secret.php`, which you can find using, for example, `exec('ls');`. You can find this file by entering something like `passthru('cat secret.php');`, or one could include the file and read all variables, `include('secret.php'); var_dump(get_defined_vars());`. The possibilities are endless.

There is a subtlety if you use something like `passhtru('cat secret.php');`. In this case a PHP file is dumped directly into the HTML body, but your browser will be unable to parse the '<?php' tag. It solves this by *commenting out that tag*! So if you do this, you'll have to inspect the elements to find the HTML comment containing the flag.
