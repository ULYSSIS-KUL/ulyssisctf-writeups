The task is to get a key that is located inside the program. Some may think to use dnSpy which is possible but not the purpose of this challenge.
First thing to do is run the program. This will give the following output:
> UltimateTimer 2000 \
> Now ULTRA FAST\
> ULTRA LITE\
> ULTRA SQ\
> Please wait.....\
> You have waited 9 seconds...\
> Congrats for wasting your life...\
> Please GET OUT.

The output will stay the same if you run it multiple times.
But suddenly there is a UltimateTimer.sqlite file. Strange! After searching online for sqlite it becomes clear that this is a sort of database.
Luckily there is small program 'sqlitebrowser' to help you out. 
After opening the database with sqlitebrowser you'll see a single table 'utimer' with random names and a number.
We can't do much with that. Let's think a bit further. The program said we wasted 9 seconds. Let's try filtering the item column for the number 9.
Ok we still have a few hundres rows left
Maybe if we filter the name column for something, something like 'time'. Wow there is a row with name timer and column 9.
What would happen if we change the value to 0?

> UltimateTimer 2000\
> Now ULTRA FAST\
> ULTRA LITE\
> ULTRA SQ\
> Please wait.....\
> You have waited 0 seconds...\
> Congrats for wasting your life...\
> Please GET OUT.\

Ok so the timer changes but we're not a step further. Let's try something larger like 15.

> UltimateTimer 2000\
> Now ULTRA FAST\
> ULTRA LITE\
> ULTRA SQ\
> Please wait.....\
> You have waited 14 seconds...\
> Congrats for wasting your life...\
> Even longer...\

Awesome we got it! After wasting our life...
