# capacity writeup
This is a simple buffer overflow challenge. The input buffer (which stores the password you entered), the error message and the login password (which is checked against) are stored next to eachother in memory. To read the password, the program uses the `gets()` function which performs no bounds checking and will thus easily overrun the buffer it is supposed to write to (for this reason, it has been removed from the C standard in C11). So, all you have to do is enter a sufficiently long password to overrun the buffer, past the error message, into the password to check. This lets you 'choose' the correct password yourself and log in.

The only catch here is that the `strcmp()` function compares two *null-terminated* strings. As such, a null byte has to be inserted after 12 characters and care must be taken not to overrun the password buffer so `strcmp()` actually receives two identical strings.
