# silverman writeup 

At first glance, the silverman website doesn't look too interesting. However, if we look closely, we can see a small "admin" link. If we click the link, we get a prompt asking for a username. Of course, we could try to brute-force the username, and the likely password that would be asked next, but maybe if we look closer at the source coude we can solve this without much effort.

If we inspect the website code, we can see the link isn't a link at all. Instead, the browser executes a Javascript function, "authenticate", when the link is clicked. That function isn't defined anywhere however. Or is it? In the `<head>`, the "js.js" script is included.

When we take a look at the "js.js" file, we can clearly see the username, and password in plaintext! Finally, we just enter the credentials and get redirected to a secret adming page with the flag!
