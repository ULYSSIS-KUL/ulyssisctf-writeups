## Storage
'storage' is a fairly simple directory traversal challenge. The application is a simple cloud storage application which simply uses the host's file system as its backend. So, naturally, the file paths are sanitized to protect against directory traversal.

The user names aren't, though. The application stores the files for each user in a directory that is just the folder's name. So all it takes is a directory called `..` and you will find yourself at the root directory of the application, easily able to read the files of any users. However, I decided to hide the flag in the password file, which is just a plaintext file.
