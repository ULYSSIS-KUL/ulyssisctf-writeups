# chatty4

This is the fourth version of the notorious Chatty Bot. It's a chat bot able to respond to users based on recognising certain keywords. Its response are then encoded. In the past ascii numbers, rot13 and a Caesar cipher were used, this year it's the binary representation of the ascii numbers (a bit of a throwback to the first version). Simply googling parts of responses already gives this away. But on top of that all responses are in groups of 8 binary characters, which also hints at ascii. You also see a lot of 100000 which is the representation of a space and 1001001 for capital I. If you ask for the flag, chatty says you need to tell him he's your favourite bot. If you mention "favourite bot" in your message, the bot will respond with the flag. You then simply have to decode it as you've done with all previous messages.
