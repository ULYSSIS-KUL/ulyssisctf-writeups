# the-greatest-flag writeup
In this challenge you are given a simple .jpg file of the greatest flag in the world. Since its a stego challenge and the flavourtext hints towards something being hidden in this flag, the next step would be to try and open the jpg in a text editor.

Once this is done, a simple search for the FLG will find you the solution.
