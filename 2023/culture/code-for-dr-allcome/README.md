# code-for-dr-allcome

This challenge is a culture challenge that tries to acquaint people with the 1995 cyberpunk cult classic "Johnny Mnemonic". As a culture challenge, it simply requires some basic internet searching. Simply by looking up Dr. Allcome, it's already possible to figure out the connection with this movie, but also many of the images feature text that refers to the movie (William Gibson, Pharmakom, Free City of Newark, New Darwin Inn, Sogo 7 Data Gloves, Sino-Logic 16). Based on the movie title and the terms download codes or access codes, you can easily find clips of the movie where the images are shown (but requiring a timely pause for the last image) or even reproductions of the original print by fans. Once the three correct images are entered (a cartoon superhero, an image of the STOP NAS NOW protests, and the face of Anna Kalmann's digital consciousness), the flag is displayed as part of the version report number.
