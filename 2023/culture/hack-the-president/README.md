# hack-the-president writeup

Immediately clear from the start is that this challenge is themed in the Fallout game style. This is a hint that the needed information will have to be sought in the Fallout games. You are first greeted with a terminal-like interface which is seen as the interface to the AI John Henry Eden (which if looked up, is from the story of the Fallout 3 game). Few commands are available. Some give information about who you are dealing with and are there as reference to the game, but hints are also dropped by referencing to a destruct sequence (which was the objective of the challenge).

Next you have to use your search engine, to find this destruct sequence (by using terms like: 'ZAX destruct sequence' or 'Eden destruct code fallout'). Soon enough you will come across a holotape (in-game audio fragment) like on the Fallout Fandom wiki, which has a destruct code for John President Eden (420-03-20-9). When you enter this code in the interface, you get the flag.
