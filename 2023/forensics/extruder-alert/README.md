# extruder-alert writeup
## Solution
There are two hints pointing towards our first step in the solving-process. The whole clue of the challenge is that we're working with a GCODE file, a filetype used for devices such as 3D-printers, lasercutter, etc. Our first clue is the name of the challenge "Extruder-alert", extruder hinting towards the extruder of filament on a 3D printer. The second hint is in the flavortext where I mentioned "My friend must assume I won the CTF", since the main prices are 3D-printers. Someone might aswell look up parts of the code and look those up, these should be able to lead to the GCODE filetype. From there on it should be fairly simply. The next step is to change the file back to '.gcode' instead of '.html' . Someone who is experienced with 3D-printing might throw the file into their favourite Open-Source slicer, or they could look up an online gcode analyzer. Now they're able to inspect the original 3D-object and the FLAG will be revealed.
## Inspiration
I own a 3D-printer. I've had first hand experience in finding a gcode file without knowing what the original 3D-object was. Furthermore, I thought it would make a nice challenge since the grandprize is a 3D-printer this year.
