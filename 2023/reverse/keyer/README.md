The flavortext links you to a binary. Upon opening this binary in ghidra and analyzing it, you can go to the _main function and inspect the code. You'll notice that all the numbers are summed up ("-" is ignored) and modulo'd by 4, 5 and 6. The sum of the numbers must thus also be divisble by 4, 5 and 6 and it has to be in the format of XXX-XXXXXXX. You can then just make up a license key following the format and the restraints by just using an example fitting but banned one like 666-6666666, but incrementing the last number by one, and decrementing the before last number by one. Example: 666-6666657. You can then fill this in on the web interface and get the flag.
