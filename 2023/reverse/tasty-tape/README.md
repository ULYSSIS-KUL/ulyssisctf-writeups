# tasty-tape writeup
In the flavorext you can find the two words "tape" and "bagel", doing a bit of research on Google with the word "esolanguage" should land you on writeups of other similar challenges or a [wiki page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/TapeBagel) of the esolanguage community. On this page, the whole language is explained, however, only 5 simple instructions are used.
The reset to zero `%%`, increment `%++`, output integer as character `@*`, output integer as integer `@@*` and reset all integers to zero `##`.

There's also an interpreter on [GitHub](https://github.com/jashanbhoora/TapeBagel-Interpreter) but it's in Python 2 so you'd have to convert it.

Alternatively, you could analyse the script and figure it out that way.
