# hacker-realm writeup

Hacker Realm shows a [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) installation. Most pages appear to be inaccessible if you are not logged in. You also cannot create a new account. The content of the wiki looks potentially interesting though... would there be a way to access it without account?

The home page shows a change log of the wiki, with revision numbers and a bit of explanation. This list mentions that the wiki is created using MediaWiki 1.35.4.

MediaWiki 1.35.4 is an old version of MediaWiki, which was found to have [a few severe security vulnerabilities](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/2021-12_security_release/FAQ) in December 2021. So the version of Hacker Realm is still vulnerable, in a way that an attacker can view the contents of arbitrary revisions, even without the necessary permissions.

The change log gives away that the revision ID for the "Hacker secrets" page (which sounds very interesting) is `3`, and that the revision ID for the latest home page edit is `4`. Using the vulnerable "undo" feature, you could construct the following URL that exposes the contents of revision 3: `http://127.0.66.1/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=edit&undo=4&undoafter=3`. This page would then show the flag.
