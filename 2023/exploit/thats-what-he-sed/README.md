We are given a web interface where we can enter a "pattern", and some "input".
By default, the pattern is set to `s/e/3/`, and input is set to `Hello world!`.
If we press the "Submit" button, we get a result back, which is `H3llo world!`.

The site is indeed what it claims to be, an online tool to execute sed scripts.
But what *is* sed, actually? Looking at the [manual
page](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sed.1.html), it has a very
interesting section:

> ### --sandbox
>
> operate in sandbox mode (disable e/r/w commands).

After some more time spent looking things up, it turns out that these command
allow one to respectively execute, read from, and write to files!

So what if we try `r /etc/passwd` as pattern?

> Output: hello world! root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash [...]

Oh... And what about `e ls`?

> Output: main.py requirements.txt secret hello world!

Looks like we can read the challenge's source code using `r main.py` as well.
But what is this `secret` file? Let's try reading it:

> Output: hello world! FLG{cfa5b00bab3d869cc73061e6e1806ec06c87591dd515}
