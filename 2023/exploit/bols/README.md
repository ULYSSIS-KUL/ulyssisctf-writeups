# bols writeup

In this challenge we are presented with a beautiful-looking HTML page and a login form. Upon entering the username and password, a table listing orders is populated. This does not require a page load, suggesting that it is populated with JavaScript code.

Looking at the page's source code, we indeed see a JS script which fetches the data. Interestingly, the data is fetched by sending a *whole SQL query* to the site! Thus, we can modify the challenge, for example to `SELECT * FROM orders;`, and the table is populated by partial data. This partial data includes the flag! Challenge completed.
