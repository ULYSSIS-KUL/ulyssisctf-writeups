# quickdrive writeup
In this challenge, we are presented with a webpage which allows us to upload files and view them. These include images and webpages we can view, but also, conspicuously, a file named "flag.php". Trying to open this file does not give us the flag, however: it results in a PHP error code, owing to the use of a recently removed function.

But wait. This is a file, presumably uploaded through this same interface, which can *run code*? What can we do with this? Well, what if we uploaded this file, "exploit.php"?

```
<?php
readfile("flag.php");
```

This works, and shows us that flag.php reads the flag from an environment variable! We are only a second file away from victory:

```
<?php
echo getenv("FLAG");
```

[Exploits such as this](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload), allowing attackers to upload an executable php file to gain shell access, have plagued sites for years.
Remember kids, watch out who can upload files, and where!
