> I found this very weird painting in a museum. They say that it holds a secret. There's no hidden safe behind it, so I'm all out of ideas. Can you help me out?

We are given a weird-looking image, which is supposed to be a painting.

This "painting" turns out to be not just a painting, but a program in the esoteric programming language ["Piet"](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet), named after the neoplastic artist Piet Mondriaan.

Find yourself an interpreter, e.g. [npiet](https://www.bertnase.de/npiet/) and give the file as input. That should print the flag.
