# keyboard-smashing-time writeup
If the correct key is pressed the character will show up together with it's index. The index resets after going trough the complete flag, this way it doesn't matter if you don't remember one of the characters.
While it is possible to do this manually it would be better to automate this process.

The FLG at the start of the flag are capital letters while the letters in the hexadecimal code are lowercase!
