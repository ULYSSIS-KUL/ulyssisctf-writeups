# bols writeup

We can see at the bottom of this website of this beautiful airline that it is uses sqlite3. The comment syntax for sqlite is `--`. When we try breaking out of the string by inserting `'--` we get a weird message ` Array ( [0] => 00000 [1] => [2] => ) `. This is probably an error, meaning we succesfully broke out of the string. As thre string is probably part of the `SELECT` part of the query, we try `' OR TRUE --` to make all checks positive, and comment later requirements out. Here we see a hidden flight from `FLG{...}` to Brussels that we couldn't find earlier. We have our flag.
