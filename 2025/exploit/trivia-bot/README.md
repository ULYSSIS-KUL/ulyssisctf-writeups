There are multiple ways to solve this challenge.

1. You could solve the trivia questions and recieve the flag at the end. However if you get one question wrong, the questions reset and shuffle whithout telling you. Which could leave you stuck in an infinite loop.

2. You can see the answer for the trivia if you inspect the page and look at the JavaScript. You can then simply use the correct answers to answer the trivia and get the flag at the end!

3. In the same file as the answers, you can find an API-call to a php file. Manually going to this file in the browser will show you the flag aswell.
