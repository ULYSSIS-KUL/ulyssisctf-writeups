# chatty5

This is the fifth version of the notorious Chatty Bot. It's a chat bot able to respond to users based on recognising certain keywords. Its response are then encoded. In the past ascii numbers, rot13, a Caesar cipher and binary ascii were used, this year it's an alphabet mapping (a is 01, z is 26, 0 is a, 9 is j, characters like ' and . as well as whitespace are left unchanged). Simply googling parts of responses already gives this away. For example googling 0805121215 will give you several websites explaining it's "hello". Furthermore, it's easy to deduce based on repeated combinations like phrases starting with an isolated 09 for "I" or 09 followed by ' for I'm  and similar constructions. There are many other hints that can get you to figure it out. If you ask for the flag, chatty says you need to guess his favourite colour. If you mention "blue" in your message, the bot will respond with the flag. You then simply have to decode it as you've done with all previous messages. The added difficulty is that the flag is the first occurence of numbers encoded as letters, but since the flag format and length are known, it's not very difficult to decode.
