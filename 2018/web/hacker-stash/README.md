# Hacker Stash

> Every l33t hacker needs to hide their stuff. Thank god there's websites for that. Margo Wallace does seem to be a pretty big n00b. Her account might be interesting though.

## Write-up

Hacker Stash was only solved by 2 teams. People ended up heavily overthinking this challenge.

The description of the challenge gives a huge hint. It refers to the name Margo Wallace. Not only does that point you towards the correct user (mwall) on the user list, but it's also one of the many references to the movie Hackers from 1995. Other hints that it has something to do with the movie are the title, the title's font (though I didn't expect anyone to recognise that), the slogan "hack the planet", a gif that's from the movie, and a large amount of the hacker names in the list (Zero Cool, The Plague, Acid Burn, Lord Nikon, Cereal Killer, The Phantom Phreak, Crash Override and to a certain extend The Mentor). Simply searching online for Margo Wallace and hack or hacker gives you the movie and should link things together.

The next step is finding out what mwall's password might be, based on the movie of course. The movie has a rather well known quote/concept that the four most commonly used passwords are love, sex, secret and god. Where god is the password that's used by Margo Wallace. You could find it rather easily in many quote databases, both by the young hackers, as well as in a dialog between Margo and The Plague. If you look for images of Margo Wallace with hack or hackers included, you will also find an image of a large screen array with "password accepted god".

Once you login with mwall as the username and god as the password, you can find the flag inside a file labeled "garbage". This is another reference to the movie, but, since there were only a few files to browse, it didn't matter if you didn't get that last reference.
