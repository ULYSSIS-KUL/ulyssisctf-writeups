# Chatty

> Chatty is a pretty simple chatbot. Usually I wouldn't talk to him, but he knows a flag. Can you understand what he's saying?

## Write-up

This challenge was solved by every team, so this write-up is rather redudant.

The chat bot simply reacts to certain words it knows. Any phrase that includes the word flag will have the bot respond with the flag.

All messages by chatty the chat bot are transmitted as ascii numbers instead of regular text, this was the (somewhat) challenging part of this challenge.
