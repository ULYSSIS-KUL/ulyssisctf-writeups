This challenge apparently confused quite a bunch of people (who may or may not have failed to read all that nice text I wrote for this challenge). The point of this challenge was to be a reference to [That Scene From War Games](https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHWjlCaIrQo). Some people got somewhat confused, however:

- Starting with the intro text, there were a couple of distractions
  - The title and opening quote from the flavor text are a reference to [this amazing song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBX2VLhjiUo). This was just supposed to be another hint at the fact that "nuclear war is bad, yo", and the quote "I'm not gonna play if there ain't no way I'll win" ties in quite well with [this quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DGNZnfKYnU).
  - There was also a jab at Reagan, who presumably would have started a nuclear war if he thought he could win, this ended in someone guessing "0000" as the nuclear launch code.
- Going over to the first page, a prompt asking for nuclear launch codes (along with a reference to the War Games character Dr. Falken, and the WOPR computer). Some people just tried submitting random strings of text from this page (and the following pages).
- If you google around a bit, you can easily find the launch codes. Entering these leads you to a confirmation page
  - Pressing NO would give you the flag, along with [this quote again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DGNZnfKYnU).
  - Most people, however, pressed YES, choosing to blow up the world. They were faced with a page telling them we'd now have to rebuild the world, please come back later. Going back and pressing NO would show them a page saying we're still rebuilding, [and also some other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy3dIicSI_0). After five minutes, however, the world would be rebuilt, and they could go on to press NO. Some people however, are terrible at reading, and would try our message telling them nuclear war is bad as a flag. They'd also get super confused when some other team member would try pressing NO after the world was rebuilt (destroying the world would destroy it for your entire team), and suddenly they'd get the flag, while the first member would only get a message saying they're a terrible person.

In short, it might be useful for some to educate themselves on popular hacker movies and possibly reconsider their ethics when it comes to possibly starting a nuclear war.
